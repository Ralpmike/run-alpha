<p className="leading-relaxed text-base font-light italic md:text-lg tracking-wider">
  One of the key pillars of our investment strategy is the use of quantitative methods. These strategies allow us to manage investments with a level of precision that traditional methods simply cannot achieve.
  <br />
  <br />
  By applying mathematical models and algorithms to vast datasets, we are able to identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent to the human eye. This ability to process and analyze large sets of information quickly and accurately allows us to make informed, data-driven decisions in real-time.
